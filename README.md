# TrafficPrediction_Proj
Traffic Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to develop a robust traffic prediction model using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical traffic data and real-time inputs, the model forecasts traffic conditions, helping to manage vehicle movement, reduce congestion, and optimize routes.

Features
Data Collection: Aggregates traffic data from various sources, including sensors, GPS, and historical records.
Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the data to handle missing values, outliers, and noise.
Modeling: Implements machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and Neural Networks to predict traffic flow and congestion.
Evaluation: Uses metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance.
Visualization: Provides visual insights through graphs and charts to understand traffic patterns and predictions.
